# GitHub Owner Dropdown Issue

When registering a GitHub App, users may encounter a dropdown labeled "Owner" on the app registration page. This dropdown allows users to select the account or organization under which the app will be registered. If the desired organization is not selected, the app may not be associated with the correct account, leading to potential issues with permissions and functionality.

## Steps to Ensure Correct Selection

1. **Locate the Owner Dropdown**: On the GitHub App registration page, find the dropdown labeled "Owner" near the top of the form.

2. **Select the Correct Organization**:
   - If you are registering the app under your personal account, select your username.
   - If you are registering the app under an organization, select the organization's name from the dropdown.

3. **Verify Your Selection**: Before proceeding, double-check that the correct account or organization is selected.

4. **Complete the Registration**: Fill out the remaining fields in the registration form and submit it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Organization Not Listed**: If the desired organization does not appear in the dropdown, ensure that:
  - You are a member of the organization.
  - You have the necessary permissions to register apps for the organization.

- **Incorrect Selection**: If you accidentally register the app under the wrong account, you may need to delete the app and start the registration process again.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your GitHub App is registered under the correct account or organization, avoiding potential issues with permissions and functionality.
