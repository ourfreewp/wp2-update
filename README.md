## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these three steps to configure the plugin and start managing your private repositories.

### Step 1: Mark Your Packages for Management

To make a theme or plugin manageable by WP2 Update, you must add the `Update URI` header to its main file. The value should be the GitHub repository slug in `owner/repository` format.

**For a Theme (`style.css`):**

```css
/*
Theme Name: My Awesome Theme
Theme URI: https://example.com/my-awesome-theme
Author: Your Name
Version: 1.2.5
Update URI: your-github-username/my-awesome-theme-repo
*/
```

**For a Plugin (`my-plugin.php`):**

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: My Awesome Plugin
Plugin URI: https://example.com/my-awesome-plugin
Author: Your Name
Version: 2.1.0
Update URI: your-github-username/my-awesome-plugin-repo
*/
```

Once you add this header, the plugin will automatically appear in the Managed Packages list.

### Step 2: Create and Configure a GitHub App

1. Navigate to **GitHub Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps** and click **New GitHub App**.
2. Fill out the registration form:
   - **GitHub App name:** A descriptive name, e.g., "My WordPress Updater".
   - **Homepage URL:** The URL of your WordPress site (e.g., `https://your-site.com`).
   - **Callback URL:** Uncheck "Active". This is not needed.
3. **Webhook:**
   - Check "Active".
   - **Webhook URL:** Find this on the WP2 Update > Settings page in your WordPress admin. It will look like `https://your-site.com/wp-json/wp2-update/v1/github/webhooks`.
   - **Webhook secret:** Generate a secure secret and save it. You will need this for the plugin settings.
4. **Repository permissions:**
   - **Contents:** Read-only (Required to read repository metadata and download release assets).
   - **Metadata:** Read-only (Required by default).
5. Click **Create GitHub App**.
6. On the next page, under **Private keys**, click **Generate a private key**. A `.pem` file will be downloaded. Keep this file secure.
7. Go to the **Install App** tab and install the app on your account, granting it access to the specific repositories you want to manage. After installation, you will see an Installation ID in the URL (e.g., `.../installations/12345678`). You will need this ID.

### Step 3: Configure the Plugin in WordPress

1. Navigate to **WP2 Updates > Settings** in your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Fill in the following fields:
   - **App ID:** Found on your GitHub App's general settings page.
   - **Installation ID:** The ID you noted after installing the app on your repositories.
   - **Private Key:** Upload the `.pem` file you downloaded from GitHub.
   - **Webhook Secret:** The secret you created during the GitHub App configuration.
3. Click **Save Settings**.
4. Use the **Test Connection** button to verify that everything is configured correctly. You should see a success toast notification.
